# Rick-and-Morty-Character-Generator
<h1>A simple app that generates a random character from the show and displays basic information about them</h1>

<h2>Built with the <a href='https://rickandmortyapi.com'>Rick-and-Morty-API</a> with ðŸ’œ</h2>
<p>Creating using async and await, then displays the data from the API in the UI.</p>
<p>The UI is styled using <a href='https://getbootstrap.com'>Bootstrap 4</a></p>

<p style='color: red;'>I may change this in the future, however for now it was just a project to help me with Async / Await and the Fetch API</p>
